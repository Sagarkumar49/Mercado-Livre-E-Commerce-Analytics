# Mercado-Livre-E-Commerce-Analytics
This capstone project leverages SQL, Power BI, and Python to analyze Mercado Livre’s e-commerce operations, uncovering actionable insights to drive revenue growth, enhance customer retention, and optimize logistics.

Key Contributions:
Advanced SQL Analytics

Queried a large-scale e-commerce dataset to identify trends in revenue growth (699K% MoM spikes), customer lifetime value (top spender: R$13.6K), and product performance (120K% YoY growth in top categories).

Revealed critical gaps like low repeat purchase rates (3.12%) and inefficient logistics (only 4.41% on-time deliveries).

Interactive Power BI Dashboards

Built a 6-page dashboard tracking KPIs across sales, customer behavior, product performance, and logistics.

Highlighted actionable insights:

Revenue concentration in top categories (35% from 3 segments).

Geographic disparities (Northern states had 3× longer delivery times).

Payment dominance (73.9% revenue from credit cards).

Python Forecasting & EDA

Forecasted revenue for 24 months using Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (MAE: 255K) and Linear Regression, identifying seasonal peaks (e.g., November 2017: R$1.19M revenue).

Analyzed category-wise trends, recommending inventory prioritization for high-growth segments like health/beauty and electronics.

Strategic Recommendations

Proposed loyalty programs for high-value customers, logistics partnerships to reduce delays, and targeted marketing for underperforming regions.

Tools Used: SQL (MySQL), Power BI, Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels), Jupyter Notebooks.
Dataset: Mercado Livre’s transactional data (orders, payments, customers, products).

Impact: Demonstrated how data-driven strategies can optimize marketplace operations, reduce churn, and capitalize on seasonal trends.

Why This Stands Out:
End-to-End Analytics: Covers data extraction (SQL), visualization (Power BI), and predictive modeling (Python).

Real-World Focus: Solutions address actual business pain points (e.g., retention, logistics).

Portfolio-Ready: Clear storytelling with quantifiable results and visual deliverables.
